# Archive Directory

This directory contains temporary fix files, troubleshooting guides, and diagnostic scripts that were created during development and debugging.

These files are kept for reference but are not needed for the day-to-day operation of the application.

## Contents

- **temp-fixes/**: SQL scripts and documentation files used for debugging and fixing issues during development

## Note

If you need to reference any of these files, they're still available here. However, the actual migrations and essential documentation should be in the root directory or `supabase/migrations/`.
